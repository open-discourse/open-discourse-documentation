## State Affiliation (Wahlbundesland)

The assignment of politicians to their respective state (*Wahlbundesland*) is based on the *Stammdaten* file provided by the [German Bundestag](https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata){target="_blank"}). 

Currently only location information for politicians with direct mandates were considered. In future updates also politicians with mandates based on state lists (*Landesliste*) will be covered. 

Based on the direct mandate information, the state information for the politicians in the topic model is extrapolated for the electoral terms the respective politician did not have a direct mandate but a state list mandate.

The table below provides a complete overview of the politician and the respective state association per electoral term.

```{r}
states <- readr::read_csv("./data/state_affiliation_table.csv")
