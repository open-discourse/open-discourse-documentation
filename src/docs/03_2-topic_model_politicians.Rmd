## Politicians

For computational reasons, the topic model tool provides a selection of 270 out of the [`r nrow(politicians)` politicians](#politicians-table). This sample of politicians is drawn by a combination of three different approaches:

1. Every minister and chancellor since the 14th electoral term (26.10.1998)
2. Every opposition leader since 1949 based on this [Wikipedia list](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktionsvorsitzender).
3. The 200 most followed politicians on twitter based in this [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/912241909002833921).

Additionally we dropped every politician with less than 30 speeches in the Open Discourse corpus.

The final list of politicians can be found below (sorted by last name):


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
pols <- readr::read_csv("./data/topics/pol_selection.csv")

pols %>% 
  make_table(scrollable = TRUE)
```
